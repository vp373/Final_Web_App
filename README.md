# Final Web Application

## Project Team
1. Vaibhav Pothireddy
2. Vinit Santani
## Project Description
This was our final project where we utilized all the skills that we have gained throughout the course. 
As we have previously mentioned, we have little to no computer science background, and this class was a great gateway into
web design and general coding practices. Throughout the course we learned Some things that we learned were:
* Utilizing Version Control Systems (GIT)
* Interacting with and learn more about IDEs, especially PyCharm
* HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap
* The history of the internet, how technology interacts with each other, and why it came to be that way
* Containerization, Applications, Web Protocols, and how apps communicate through APIs
* An Intro to Databases/MySQl, and how data moves through the internet (JSON/XML)

For this project specifically we incorporated 2 new features in addition to the previously built web application:
1. A login process which includes registration as well as verification
2. A charting feature using Charts.js which consumes API endpoints


## What is this application and how can I use it?

This is a web application which allows you to view, edit, update, or delete data collected of Old Faithful's eruptions. This application requires you to create an account and login in order to utilize this app. 
To use it please follow the instructions below:
1: Clone the repository locally and open using PyCharm
2. Initialize the docker container and application using the docker-compose file 
3. Press the play button, to run the application and open the application in your browser at http://localhost:5000
4. Register and verify your email
5. Login with your new credentials to access the application
6. View, add, edit, or delete records from the dataset
7. View the chart to see some data of the Eruption time vs the time in between eruptions


## Login and Registration
Vinit worked on this feature. This will require you to create an account to login to this application. 

## Access Chart Visualization
Vaibhav worked on this feature. This chart will display 50 data points of our data to give a flavor of the relationship between the eruption length vs the time in between eruptions. You can toggle the data on or off by clicking on the legend as well.
